# Charge-Cycle
Analytical model that shows predictive capability for polyelectrolyte multilayer growth using simple charge calculations.
Attached is a Jupyter Notebook containing the model. The polymer dictionary at the beginning of the file is used for calculations. A new polyelectrolyte must be added to the dictionary for analysis.
